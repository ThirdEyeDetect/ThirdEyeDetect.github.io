                         We seek to create a countermeasure against “Facejacking”, a physical insider attack where an adversary uses a victim's personal device to access a social network, like Facebook, to gain access to sensitive information and/or to impersonate them. To do this, we must analyse how Facebook users use their account and thus, need to collect Facebook usage traces. In this study, you will be asked to install our Chrome extension, called ThirdEye, which will automatically collect your interactions with the Facebook on your computer and send this data to our server. <br>The ThirdEye extension collects user activity at two levels: 
                     <ul style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px">
                         <li><strong>Event Data</strong></li>
                         <p>Event Data is name of the event generated by an interaction on Facebook. For example, clicking on a story on your newsfeed will generate the event "News Feed Story Click".</p>
                         <br> 
                         <li><strong>Context Data</strong></li>
                         <p>Context data is information associated with the action. Following the previous example, a "News Feed Story Click" event's context data will include the URL of the visited news story, the URL of the Facebook profile of the friend who posted the story that was clicked as well as the Facebook profile URLS of the friends tagged in the story. </p>
                         <p>We try our best to ensure that we avoid collecting data related to your Facebook friends. There is, however, a chance that the extension may record some such data.
                         We mitigate this risk by not collecting names of connections associated with posts that the you view, but only for those that the you actively interact with (e.g., comments on). We also actively anonymize the identity of all your Facebook friends in the data we collect. We do this by hashing names and URLs to anonymize them. The hash values are consistent (they allow us to know if a name or URL in our dataset is the same as another one, with high probability), but we cannot recover the actual value of the name or the URL from the hash.</p>
                         <p>
                        Collection of event data is mandatory for you to participate in this study.<strong> However,  no context data will be collected unless you provide explicit permission for us to collect it. </strong></p>
                         
                         
                         <div class="container">

                     </ul>
                     <p> If the data collection is limited to Event Data only, the study is anonymous; your identity is not associated with the information we collect about your Facebook usage. If you provide explicit permission to collect context data, the study does not remain anonymous since the collected context data can be used to identify you. We implement strict measures and best security practices to ensure that your data remains safe and encrypted until we use it for analysis. You will be provided with a bonus compensation for consenting to the collection of context data. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p> All participants who allow their "Event Data" to be captured will be paid a $25 CAD honorarium with an additional $10 CAD for consenting to provide "Context Data" at the end of the study period. Leaving the study during data collection will disqualify participants from receiving compensation and we will immediatly delete their collected data from our server. </p>

                        <li><strong>Step 1: Reading and Signing the Consent Form</strong></li>
                         <p> To take part in this study, you will have to obtain a copy of the <a href="../objects/tracestudy-consent-form.pdf">consent form </a> and submit it at waliusmani (at) gmail (dot) com or give Wali Usmani a hard copy of the complete form.</p>
                        <li><strong>Step 2: Installing the Extension</strong></li>
                         Follow these instructions to install the Third Eye Data Collection Extension:
                         <div style="margin-left:35px; margin-right:35px;">
                            <ol>
                             <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/ThirdEyeDetect/ThirdEyeExtension/blob/datacollection/ThirdEyeExtension.crx">.crx</a> file to a desired location (such as your Desktop).</li>
                                <li>Go to the settings page in Chrome (click on <img src="../images/unnamed.png"/> in the top
                                right of the Chrome) and select 'Extensions'
                                on the left side of the page.</li>
                                <li>Drag the downloaded .crx file into the chrome browser and click "Add" if prompted by a confirmation popup.</li>
                                <li>The ThirdEye extension should have installed in your browser. It will automatically record Event Data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Optional:</strong> If you have chosen to provide us with context sentive data, click on the ThirdEye icon near the top-right corner of Chrome and set the "Collect Context Data: to true. </li>
                            </ol>
                         </div>
                         <li><strong>Step 3: Data Collection</strong></li>
                         The study duration will be approximately 1.5 to 2 months long, during you must use Facebook as you typically would, on the device on which you have installed the Third Eye Extension. Participants are requested to use Facebook as per norm i.e. not alter the way they interact with Facebook.
                            
                         <li><strong>Step 4: Removing the Extension</strong></li>
