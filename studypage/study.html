                         We seek to create a countermeasure against “Facejacking”, a physical insider attack where an adversary uses a victim's personal device to access a social network, like Facebook, to gain access to sensitive information and/or to impersonate them. To do this, we must analyse how Facebook users use their account and thus, need to collect Facebook usage traces. In this study, you will be asked to install our Chrome extension, called ThirdEye, which will automatically collect your interactions with the Facebook on your computer and send this data to our server. <br>The ThirdEye extension collects user activity at two levels: 
                     <ul style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px">
                         <li><strong>Event Data</strong></li>
                         <p>Event Data is name of the event generated by an interaction on Facebook. For example, clicking on a story on your newsfeed will generate the event "News Feed Story Click".</p>
                         <br> 
                         <li><strong>Context Data</strong></li>
                         <p>Context data is information assosiated with the action. Following the previous example, a "News Feed Story Click" event's context data will include the URL of the visited news story, the URL of the Facebook profile of the friend who posted the story that was clicked as well as the Facebook profile URLS of the friends tagged in the story. </p>
                     </ul>
                     <p style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px;text-indent: 50px;"> Another example of event and context data is of the action of sending a Facebook message to a friend. In this case, event data will be "FB Message" and the context data will be the Facebook URL of the friend you send the message too as well as the content of the message. Collection of event data is mandatory for you to participate in this study.<strong> However,  no context data will be collected unless you provide explicit permission for us to collect it. </strong>
                     <p style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px;text-indent: 50px;"> If the data collection is limited to Event Data only, the study is anonymous; your identity is not associated with the information we collect about your Facebook usage. If you provide explicit permission to collect context data, the study does not remain anonymous since the collected context data can be used to identify you. We implement strict measures and best security practices to ensure that your data remains safe and encrpyted until we use it for analysis. You will be provided with a bonus compensation for consenting to the collection of context data. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p> All participants who allow their "Event Data" to be caputured will be paid a $25 honorarium with an additional $10 for consenting to provide "Context Data" at the end of the study period. Leaving the study during data collection </p>

                     <h3 class="anchor" id="stdy_proc"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link">Study Procedure</span></h3>
                     
                     <ul style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px">

                         Follow these instructions to install the Third Eye Data Collection Extension:
                         <div style="margin-left:35px; margin-right:35px;">
                            <ol>
                             <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/ThirdEyeDetect/ThirdEyeExtension/blob/datacollection/ThirdEyeExtension.crx">.crx</a> file to a desired location (such as your Desktop).</li>
                                <li>Go to the settings page in Chrome (click on <img src="../images/unnamed.png"/> in the top

                                <li>The ThirdEye extension should have installed in your browser. It will automatically record Event Data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Optional:</strong> If you have chosen to provide us with context sentive data, click on the ThirdEye icon near the top-right corner of Chrome and set the "Collect Context Data: to true. </li>
                            </ol>
                         </div>
                         <li><strong>Step 3: Data Collection</strong></li>
                         The study duration will be approximately 1.5 to 2 months long, during you must use Facebook regularly on the device on which you have installed the Third Eye Extension.
                            
                         <li><strong>Step 4: Removing the Extension</strong></li>
